# Python Data Analyst Project: Student Performance Analysis

## Overview

Welcome to the **Student Performance Analysis** project! This project focuses on analyzing student performance data using Python for exploratory data analysis (EDA). The dataset includes information on students' demographics, study habits, parental background, and academic scores. The analysis aims to uncover trends, patterns, and insights to understand factors influencing student performance and inform educational strategies.

## Features

- **Data Understanding:** Exploration of dataset source, dimensions, features, and handling of missing values.
- **Data Cleaning:** Removal of irrelevant columns and modifications to study hours column.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Analysis of gender distribution, parental education levels, marital status impact, sports practice, and score distributions.
- **Data Visualization:** Visual representation of ethnic group distribution using pie charts and other visualization techniques.
- **Further Analysis:** Exploration of additional patterns, potential enhancements, and valuable insights for stakeholders.
